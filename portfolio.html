	<h1><span style = "color:blue;"><b>Using Python Turtle to Create Snake Game</b></span>
	</center>
	<p>In this project, we were asked to create an animation with the Turtle function
	in Python. Our group had designed an animation that drew inspiration from the classic
	snake game, where an object that is meant to resemble a snake navigates across a square
	map, eating apples and growing as it moves.</p>
	<p>We utilized such functions as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><q>If</q> conditional statements to check for object collisions with
		either the apples or the walls</li>
		<li><q>While</q> loops to condense snake movement into multiple iterations
		of a specific pattern</li>
		<li><q>Write</q> commands to enable the turtle object to display text</li>
	</ul>

	img {
	display: block;

	<h1><center><span style = "color:blue;"><b>Creating "Tic-Tac-Blackout" with Python</b></span></center>
	<p>Project 1.2.5 of PLTW asked that we design a game based off of our existing understanding of Python and
		whatever other resources we had at hand. Utilizing Python Turtle, our group designed a remix of tic-tac-toe:
		"Tic-Tac-Blackout." With the intent of incorporating a 'blind' twist on the traditional game,
		our group constructed a program that blacked out the screen and only lit back up upon clicking a
		section of the board and placing an 'x' or 'o.'</p>

		<p>In order to build this game, we utilized such functions as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><q>Class/def</q> functions to categorize multiple actions under singular functions
		that can be more easily called upon later within the code</li>
		<li><q>Self (instances within a class; i.e. an accessible variable x within def function)</q>
		parameter in order to create designated variables for callable functions</li>
		<li><q>For</q> loops in order to iterate through the board building sequence
		a set amount of times so that the board is arrange properly</li>
		<li><q>.onclick Turtle function</q> in order to create an interface that is directly responsive
		to player interaction</li>
	</ul>
  <h1><center>Here is what we get when we run the code:</center></h1>
